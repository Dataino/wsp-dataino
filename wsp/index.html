			<h2>Site Analysis:</h2>
			
				<p>	
					The main goal to the redesign of Snooztime’s website is to show their presence through visual identity and vivid imagery, with soothing colors and rich textures. I will also eliminate the markup clutter created by the previous designer's and replace it with a more subtle six-page layout bringing a sophisticated look to the site. Doing so I hope to convey to the sites visitors that the products of Snooztime’s are a great quality, have competitive prices and excellent customer service. This is proven by numerous positive reviews.
					With good strategic online marketing along with good branding management, will drive traffic to the site resulting with an increase in sales. Creating a quality site will allow site visitors to form a sense of trust for the business in which it will transmits a desire to become a frequent customer.<br>
				</p>
					
				
			<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
			
				<p> 
					Researching the competitors, I’ve found that there are a few companies that are similar to Snooztime’s services. They are mostly large franchised companies that have the ability to offer different categories of products than just pillows. I’ve notice that none of the competition isn’t taking advantage of the benefits of a responsive website. By redesigning Snooztime with these features I believe we will gain an advantage over the competition.

			<h2>Competitors Websites:</h2>
			
				<div id="sites">
					
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.pacificpillows.com"><strong>Pacific Pillows</strong></a></li>
							<p class="discription"> The website for Pacific Pillows is visually pleasent. It's over all layout captures your attention with organized images and color scheme. Looking at this site makes you buy it's products.
							</p>
						
						<li><a href="https://www.buythepillow.com/1/"><strong>Sobakawa Cloud Pillow</strong></a></li>
							<p class="discription"> Buy the Pillow's website is more like an infomercial. It focuses on only one product. It has a one page layout with a video demonstrating the product followed by images displaying what the product is made of. The site has a good color scheme, but lack responsiveness to different devices 
							This site gives you a feeling that you have just watched an infomercial rather than a good online experience. This type of site is a great example of what direction not to go for in a redesign site project.
